1  Medical Data Visualizer
1.1  Note
This is cool. But I guess I prefer to visualize data with d3, it feels more easier to me. We can also get some interactive charts instead of static images.

Total time: 2h

Damn, why can't I be faster, it's only about Google and reading document

1.2  Problem description
Content of this section is copied and reformatted from this repl.it, provided by FCC here.

1.2.1  Assignment
In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

1.2.1.1  Data description
The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

File name: medical_examination.csv

Feature	Variable Type	Variable	Value Type
Age	Objective Feature	age	int (days)
Height	Objective Feature	height	int (cm)
Weight	Objective Feature	weight	float (kg)
Gender	Objective Feature	gender	categorical code
Systolic blood pressure	Examination Feature	ap_hi	int
Diastolic blood pressure	Examination Feature	ap_lo	int
Cholesterol	Examination Feature	cholesterol	1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal
Glucose	Examination Feature	gluc	1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal
Smoking	Subjective Feature	smoke	binary
Alcohol intake	Subjective Feature	alco	binary
Physical activity	Subjective Feature	active	binary
Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease	Target Variable	cardio	binary
1.2.1.2  Tasks
Create a chart similar to examples/Figure_1.png, where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.

Use the data to complete the following tasks in medical_data_visualizer.py:

Add an overweight column to the data. To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value 0 for NOT overweight and the value 1 for overweight.
Normalize the data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of cholesterol or gluc is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.
Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using seaborn's catplot(). The dataset should be split by 'Cardio' so there is one chart for each cardio value. The chart should look like examples/Figure_1.png.
Clean the data. Filter out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:
diastolic pressure is higher than systolic (Keep the correct data with (df['ap_lo'] <= df['ap_hi']))
height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with (df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025)))
height is more than the 97.5th percentile
weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
Create a correlation matrix using the dataset. Plot the correlation matrix using seaborn's heatmap(). Mask the upper triangle. The chart should look like examples/Figure_2.png.
Any time a variable is set to None, make sure to set it to the correct code.

1.3  Solution
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
1.3.1  Import data
df = pd.read_csv("./medical_examination.csv")
1.3.2  Add 'overweight' column
df["overweight"] = np.where(
    df["weight"] / (df["height"] * df["height"]) * 10000 > 25,
    1,
    0,
)
Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of 'cholesterol' or 'gluc' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.

df["cholesterol"] = np.where(df["cholesterol"] == 1, 0, 1)
df["gluc"] = np.where(df["gluc"] == 1, 0, 1)
1.3.3  Draw Categorical Plot
def draw_cat_plot():
    # Create DataFrame for cat plot using `pd.melt` using just the values from
    # 'cholesterol', 'gluc', 'smoke', 'alco', 'active', and 'overweight'.
    vars = sorted(
        ["cholesterol", "gluc", "smoke", "alco", "active", "overweight"]
    )

    df_cat = pd.melt(
        df,
        id_vars=["cardio"],
        value_vars=vars,
    )

    # Group and reformat the data to split it by 'cardio'. Show the counts of
    # each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the catplot
    # to work correctly.
    df_cat = df_cat.value_counts().reset_index(name="total")

    # Draw the catplot with 'sns.catplot()'
    fig = sns.catplot(
        data=df_cat,
        x="variable",
        y="total",
        hue="value",
        col="cardio",
        kind="bar",
        order=vars,
    )
    fig.set_ylabels("total")
    fig.set_xlabels("variable")
    fig = fig.fig

    # Do not modify the next two lines
    # fig.savefig("catplot.png") # Don't save to file
    return fig
1.3.4  Draw Heat Map
def draw_heat_map():
    # Clean the data
    df_heat = df.loc[
        (df["ap_lo"] <= df["ap_hi"])
        & (df["height"] >= df["height"].quantile(0.025))
        & (df["height"] <= df["height"].quantile(0.975))
        & (df["weight"] >= df["weight"].quantile(0.025))
        & (df["weight"] <= df["weight"].quantile(0.975))
    ]

    # Calculate the correlation matrix
    corr = df_heat.corr()

    # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
    mask = np.zeros_like(corr)
    mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True

    # Set up the matplotlib figure
    # with sns.axes_style("white"):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 9))

    # Draw the heatmap with 'sns.heatmap()'
    ax = sns.heatmap(
        corr,
        mask=mask,
        vmax=0.4,
        square=True,
        fmt=".1f",
        annot=True,
    )

    # Do not modify the next two lines
    # fig.savefig("heatmap.png")
    # Don't save to file
    return fig
